          <p>Heâ€™s a good teacher , and It would be better if he could give second chance 
              for the student on final. I mean if he encourages student to study more by giving bonus 
              if they do well on exam. Everyone fails but student must be given a chance , who knows 
              they will turn up being better version of the past self.</p>

          <p>Very good and unique teaching methods,even if you don't study but listen to his lectures,
              you may fail,but you will definitely have  important knowledge of the topics. 
              Very fair grading,sometimes overgradind,but never underestimates students efforts. 
              Sometimes you may be assigned with extra tasks,or you may show extra effort,and 
              he will definitely estimate your efforts with some bonus points(but never get accustomed to it :D ).
              He is very friendly with his students.he is always welcomes students to listen to students' problems,
              difficulties and help students  in those problems.</p>
