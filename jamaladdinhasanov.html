          <p>He is a good instructor from my point of view since he is not only an instructor, 
              he guides his students in anything they want. His classes are simple and understandable. 
              The grade system is okay. He does not usually give bonus grades. The communication with students
               is respectful and full of jokes.</p>

          <p>His teaching methodology is very good, comprehensive, easy to understand. 
              He is fair when it comes to grades and grade assessment. He follows a new modern
               method in grading (for example, he focuses on giving more assignments with more weight - 
               assignments that teach students and make them enjoy it). He sometimes gives extra assignments 
               (meaning if you work hard and submit them on time, you get the point you deserve) But sometimes
                he doesn’t give any extras if he thinks that you can get high grade from the course by yourself. 
                He doesn’t curve. His communication with the students is probably one of the best parts about him.</p>
