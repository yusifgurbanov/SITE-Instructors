   <p class="quote">"Our goal is that at the end of each course our students would not only say 'I know', they would also say 'I can'. 
       We see SITE students as ambitious minds aspired to tackle global challenges, as decent citizens committed to the highest ethical standards,
        and as able young professionals ready to use the power of technologies for bringing solutions to real-life problems. 
        Their study programs are not only about technical knowledge and skills, 
        they learn how to communicate efficiently, to persuade and lead others towards a common mission."

      <p>I can not understand Yusubov’s explanation, because of separated explanation.
           He speaks general and doesn't give specific examples: therefore,
            I can’t catch the main point all the time</p>

          <p>He is good at his job. Mr.Yusubov always tries to teach with examples from life and 
              it really helps us to get the topic. Of course, he gives us bonus and I like it because 
              all students needs bonus:).He has really good communication skills.</p>

          <p>Dr. Yusubov is a dean of SITE and he is responsible for how modern the curriculum is. 
              However, sadly what we see today in SITE is a sad situation - nearly vast majority of its students
               lost their motivation and do not benefit from the classes. I believe that curves should be made to 
               the students.</p>
