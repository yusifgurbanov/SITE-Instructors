<p class="quote">"I taught in several universities (Baku Engineering University, UFAZ, ASOIU, ADA University) 
    since 2005. During this time I gave lectures in many branches of modern mathematics. During the last 5 years,
     I was more interested in teaching mathematics to nonmathematicians especially computer engineering, 
     computer science and IT students. The other aspect of my pedagogical activity is problem-solving. 
     I believe that real mathematics can be taught only using healthy problem-solving activities. 
     I organized problem-solving groups to solve new problems published in international mathematical journals.
      I am always happy to solve difficult problems with my students. My lecture style is also based 
      on using exercises and advanced problems to promote interest in mathematics students.
       My research fields include Sturm-Liouville Theory, Geometrical Inequalities, 3x+1 Problem and 
       History of Mathematics. Outside of Mathematics I am interested in Languages 
       (English, Russian, Turkish, German, French, Arabic). I am also an admirer of Martial Arts especially Kung Fu."

            <p>Professor gives clear explanation and explains topic in such way that student understands. 
                Grading system sometimes weird because for mechanic error cuts more points. 
                Not always gives extra points.</p>
